# Running Tests
**Note**: since django contains test files within app directories, you can find our tests within the below files
- busstop/tests.py file 
- ticket/tests.py file

## To run tests:
- make sure you have your virtual environment activated prior to running tests
- run the below command within the project directory  
    `$ python manage.py test busstop ticket`

    This will run all tests
